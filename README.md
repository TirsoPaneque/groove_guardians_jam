This project involves training a machine learning model to predict music genres based on various audio features. Utilizing libraries such as Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM, a range of classifiers, including Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and MLP, are implemented. The model's effectiveness is evaluated using metrics such as ROC AUC, F1 score, accuracy, and confusion matrix analysis, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of its ability to classify different genres accurately.
