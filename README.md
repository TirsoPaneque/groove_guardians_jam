This project involves training a machine learning model to predict music genres based on various audio features. Utilizing libraries such as Scikit-learn, XGBoost, a range of classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and MLP, are implemented. The model's effectiveness is evaluated using metrics such as F1 score, accuracy, and confusion matrix analysis (couldnt finish working on that due to time), allowing for a comprehensive assessment of its ability to classify different genres accurately.
